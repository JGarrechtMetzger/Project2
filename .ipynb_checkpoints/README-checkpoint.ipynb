    "This project can be used to understand what features a Craigslist ad posting may be predictive of the posted instrument sale price in the San Francisco Bay Area.  The feature testing of different ad attributes (e.g., time of post, location of post, length of post title) will help Craigslist users identify which attributes are most associated with ads with higher posted sale prices.  This is turn may be used to help guide users' own advertisement construction and implementation.  For example, if different neighborhood tags from the same geographic area (e.g., \\\"Oakland\\\" vs. \\\"94952\\\") predict different prices for the same item type, it may be beneficial to chose the location designation associated with higher posting price. This project will also help identify ad attributes that do not predict higher posted prices.  Initial results suggest that length of title, day of the week, and the inclusion of a picture do not predict higher posting price although more data needs to be collected to thoroughly explore this relationship.\n",
